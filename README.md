**KlakHAP** is a Unity plugin that allows playing back a video stream encoded
with the [HAP video codecs].

HAP is a fast and high-quality video codec often used in real-time interactive
applications. From the HAP Codecs website:

> The HAP codecs are designed to fit the needs of a variety of real-time video
> workflows where ultra high resolution video is needed such as live event
> production, set design, 360 video for gaming, projection mapping and creative
> coding.

KlakHAP provides video frames as textures that can be used in any way on
Unity's rendering pipeline — attaching to a material, presenting a full-screen
video, animating a UI element, etc. Thanks to the performant design and
implementation of the HAP codecs, it can dynamically control the playback
time/speed without any hiccups.

System requirements
-------------------

- Unity 2019.4 or later

At the moment, KlakHAP only supports 64-bit desktop platforms (Windows, macOS
and Linux).

Supported formats
-----------------

KlakHap supports **HAP**, **HAP Alpha** and **HAP Q**. At the moment **HAP Q
Alpha** is not supported.

KlakHap only supports QuickTime File Format as a container — in other words,
it only supports `.mov` files.

Installation
------------

This package uses the [scoped registry] feature to resolve package
dependencies. Please add the following sections to the manifest file
(Packages/manifest.json).

[scoped registry]: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html

To the `scopedRegistries` section:

```
{
  "name": "Keijiro",
  "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
  "scopes": [ "jp.keijiro" ]
}
```

To the `dependencies` section:

```
"jp.keijiro.klak.hap": "0.1.19"
```

After changes, the manifest file should look like below:

```
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "Keijiro",
      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
      "scopes": [ "jp.keijiro" ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "jp.keijiro.klak.hap": "0.1.19",
    ...
```

How to specify a video file
---------------------------

There are two methods to specify a video file in the plugin:

- **Streaming Assets Mode**: Put a video file in the [Streaming Assets]
  directory and specify its file name.
- **Local File System Mode**: Put a video file somewhere in local drive
  and specify its full path name.

The former method is recommended when the video file is delivered within the
application. The latter method is useful when it needs to play an external
content.

Hap Player component

**File Path** and **Path Mode** are used to specify a source video file. Please
see the previous section for details.

**Time**, **Speed** and **Loop** are used to set the initial playback state.
You can also use these values to change the current state while playing.

**Target Texture** is used to store decoded frames into a render texture. Note
that it allocates a small amount of GPU time for data transfer.

**Target Renderer** is used to apply a decoded texture to a specific material
property. Although it's the most performant way to render video frames, it
needs a few additional steps to be rendered correctly. The following points
should be taken into account:

- UV coordinate incompatibility: Decoded textures will be upside-down due to
  the difference in the UV coordinates conventions between Unity and HAP. It can
  be fixed using a vertically-inverted texture scale/offset. You can also use
  the `Klak/Hap` shader for this purpose.
- Color space conversion for HAP Q: [YCoCg conversion] must be added to a
  shader when using HAP Q. You can also use the `Klak/HAP Q` for this purpose.

How to control playback
-----------------------

`HapPlayer` only provides a few properties/methods for controlling playback.
This is an intentional design choice; I don't like to introduce ambiguity by
adding common methods like `Play`, `Stop` or `Pause`. You can use the basic
properties/methods to control playback instead.

- To jump to a specific point: Assign a time in seconds to `time`.
- To jump to a specific frame: Calculate the time in seconds using `frameCount`
  and `streamDuration` then assign it to `time`.
- To reverse the playback direction: Assign a negative value to `speed`.
- To pause: Assign `0` to `speed`.
- To resume: Assign `1` to `speed`.
- To stop: Assign `false` to `enabled`.
- To close the video file: Destroy the `HapPlayer` component.
- To open another video file: `AddComponent<HapPlayer>` then call `Open`.

Timeline support
----------------

The HAP Player component implements the [ITimeControl] interface that makes
it able to control the playback time from a Control Track in a [Timeline].
You can easily create a control track with drag-and-dropping a HAP Player
game object into the Timeline Editor, or manually create a Control Track/Clip
and set the source game object.
